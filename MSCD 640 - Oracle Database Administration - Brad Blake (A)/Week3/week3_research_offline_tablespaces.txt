3. What are some reasons to take a tablespace offline? How might that affect the users?

A tablespace may be taken off line in order to:
--disable an application which accesses that tablespace while the app. is updated
--make part of the database inaccessible while keeping the rest active
--perform a cold backup
--recover data from a tablespace

Note: You can never take the SYSTEM tablespace offline as access to the data dictionary is required.

It should also be noted that tablespaces cannot be taken offline if any rollback segments
contained in it are in use.  Also, if the database is shutdown while the tablespace is offline,
upon restarting the database the tablespace will NOT come back online!

This affects the users in multiple ways.  As far as selection goes, users cannot see any data
contained within the tablespace while it is offline, nor can hey complete new transactions on 
the data.  Any transactions which haven't been committed but were completed aren't affected
in that they will be committed from the rollback data.
