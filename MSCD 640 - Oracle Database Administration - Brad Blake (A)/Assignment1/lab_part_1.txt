prompt I am recommending we upgrade from the Oracle Standard Edition to the Oracle Enterprise Edition for our database software. As
prompt an E-Commerce company, we need to realize that our Standard Edition provides low volume support via Web Access, while the Enterprise
prompt Edition allows for multiple and high-volume web connections (and supports web-based and client/server applications!)
prompt While the Standard Edition allows for multiple users, it isn't designed for high volume usage and is intended for a 
prompt very small number of people.  If we would like users to connect via the web, our base of connecting users will grow
prompt dramatically.  The Enterprise Edition allows for high concurrency of user connections to the database.  Similarly, right now
prompt we are struggling with connectivity to a mere one table (product).  Standard Edition assumes low volume while the EE supports
prompt high volume.  With multiple people connecting both internally and via the web, this high volume data connection will be all
prompt but necessary if we plan on growing.  Please consider allowing for an upgrade to the Oracle Enterprise Edition.

prompt Chapter 3, Question 1
prompt  What options would you use in the DBCA for the described database scenario
prompt step1: I'd select Create a Database for more than obvious reasons
prompt step2: I'd select General Purpose. Although it is mainly for data warehousing (as the data won't change), 
prompt 25 branches will be loading data to the system, so there will be both input and output in this system.
prompt step3: Select a fitting name and sid
prompt step4: Configure for OEM so the Enterprise Manager can be used to maintain
prompt step5: Select Passwords
prompt step6: Sleect ASM as there will be I/O from multiple locations, so ASM can optimize the database for us
prompt step7: Use database file locations from template such that your datafiles' locations will be standard
prompt step8: Check 'Enable Archiving' as we'll want to archive the redo logs in case of a necessary recovery
prompt step9: Check Oracle Data Mining as we'll be doing statistical analysis, and check Enterprise Mgr. Repository
prompt step10: Typical - ASM is on and from my understanding, this will adjust our database to run at optimal
prompt performance instead of our customizing.  Pool/Buffer sizes can be changed later if necessary.
prompt step11: Verify where we want our file locations to be stored at
prompt step12: Generate the scripts so we can run them and manually watch for errors while the database is created

prompt Chapter 3, Question 2
prompt Using the User-Managed File Management method will allow the DBA to alleviate performance issues on this new 3-drive server
prompt through the utilization of mutliple tablespaces and log files on different disks, while customizing the size and name scheme
prompt as well as the file locations of these files.  Currently the CAR_PART and ENGINE_PART table are quite large and frequently
prompt accessed.  When using 10g's user-managed files, we will be able to place those two tables in separate tablespaces stored on
prompt separate disk drives. By keeping these tablespaces on separate disk drives, they will not compete against each other for 
prompt priority in writing to the hard disks.  Likewise, the redologs, along with being multiplexed, can be kept on separate drives 
prompt such that the redo logs for CAR_PART can be multiplexed on the F and G drive and the redo logs for the ENGINE_PART table can 
prompt be multiplexed on the G and H drives. Along with increasing performance, this will provide for excellent backup precautions.

prompt Chapter 3, Question 3
prompt By utiling Oracle 10g's Oracle Managed Files system, along with Automatic Storage Management (AMS), we will be able to
prompt have Oracle optimize our I/O issues for us. ASM optimizes our control files, data files, and redo log files after we select
prompt the file locations, which we can spread out such that our tables CAR_PART and ENGINE_PART reside on tablespaces which are being
prompt written to different disks on our F,G,H configuration so they need not compete for processing power.  Using OMF and ASM will
prompt allow Oracle to monitor size adjustment and the deletion of files when necessary, freeing more time for the DBA's to focus
prompt on other issues.

prompt Chapter 3, Question 4
prompt The errors I found were:
prompt # before the Cache and I/O comment field
prompt No comma should be between parameters (specifically the db_block_size and db_doman parameters)
prompt Note:  Although the most common size for db_block_size is 8192 bites and this one is at 4096, I don't see this as an "error"
prompt so I will leave it alone
prompt The remote_logoin_passwordfile is set to EXCLUSIVE.  This is the default value so this isn't necessary to have in here.  I will remove it.
prompt Spaces in the quotes of the control_file location will be removed
prompt Need .'s in the compatible Oracle version, will add them, and the version in teh control file directory is 10.1.0, not 10.0.1 as the parameter indicates
prompt DATABASE NAME needs a comment # before it
prompt db_name has the db_domain in it, this is unnecessary.  the db_domain will be taken off the db_name parameter
prompt db_name and db_domain will be placed next to each other for clarity
prompt Here is my corrected init.ora file

prompt  #Cache and I/O

prompt Chapter 3, Question 10
prompt What are the DBCA differences in a Data Warehouse and Transaction Processing model
prompt Difference 1: db_file_multiblock_read_count is 32 on DW and only 8 on TP
prompt This is because the larger the value, the faster Oracle can read tables.  On a data warehouse, no writing (input) is done to the data.
prompt So this amount can be larger, however, on a transaction processing database, it is smaller to allow for more input.
prompt Difference 2: pga_aggregate_target is 32mb on Data warehouse, but only 16MB on Transaction Processing
prompt This is because the program global area (PGA) is used more in a data warehouse than in an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
prompt Difference 3: Data Warehouse enables star_transformation
prompt The only database design that uses a star schema is the Data Warehouse, so this is only necessary here

prompt Chapter 5, Question 4
prompt It is difficult for a DBA to manage a tablespace when the storage within tables are constantly being increased.  By simply taking
prompt one field from a value of char(50) to char(100), the size of that field has doubled.  When the size of fields increase,
prompt the table can fill its MAXEXTENTS limit quickly, as when that is reached the table (or any other schema object) cannot
prompt continue to grow.  Likewise, when a tablespace reaches its capacity, productivity comes to a halt until the database can be 
prompt increased in size.  I would recommend that the tablespace be modified with the parameters of MAXEXTENTS UNLIMITED and 
prompt AUTOEXTEND ON such that the tables can grow to an unlimited extent size, and so that the tablespace can increase in size
prompt without bringing the database's productivity to a halt.


prompt Chapter 5, Question 5
prompt An extent is the smallest group of data that can be entered or retrieved from a database's memory.  A table, 
prompt (which is the largest out of the extent, segment, and table) is a schema object which has one segment per partition 
prompt it is stored on.  If a table is only stored on one partition, it only has one segment. A
prompt segment is made up of as many extents as it takes in order to fulfull the table's storage needs.

prompt Make the second datafile expandable forever
prompt ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE 'C:\temp\cust_serv02.dbf' AUTOEXTEND ON;
prompt ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE 'C:\temp\cust_serv02.dbf' MAXEXTENTS UNLIMITED;

prompt I think a benefit of having an unlimited datafile would be production.  When a datafile is filled, the time doesn't
prompt need to be taken to enlarge the datafile as autoextend takes care of this for you.  I would think a con of this would be
prompt that the tablespace could grow to fill a hard disk and cause a database crash.
