Data Pump is a new feature in Oracle 10g which adds to the current import/export features (which 
are used to dump data and import dumped data files to and from databases).  This feature is superior
to 9i's import/export in that it is much faster, and it can be restarted without data loss (in case of an import or
export failure).  Also, Data Pump can transfer data from server to server without using a dump file.

Flashback is a feature new to 10g which has many uses.  Flashback can be used to see old data
through a select statement.  Flashback can undrop a table which was dropped by mistake. Also, flashback
can be used to find which specific changes were made in a transaction within the database.

Automatic Shared Memory Management is also new in Oracle 10g.  This feature automatically finds the
best size for various memory pools & buffers (such as the shared pool and java pool).  This is 
beneficial as a DBA doesn't have to manually tune & test to discover the best sizes for these
parameters.

Transportable tablespaces are another benefit new to 10g.  This allows tablespaes in which the 
data of a database is stored to be moved to different platforms.  This is helpful if a tablespace need
to be moved from, say, a Windows 2003 server to a UNIX server.
