I created a test.csv file on the local file system in /home/hadoop and then

created the table in hive with 

CREATE TABLE test (num INT, name STRING, letter STRING, color STRING);

Then to pull the csv in, I ran the following command

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH './test.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE test;

then a select statement shows the following

hive> SELECT * FROM test;

OK

NULL NULL NULL NULL

NULL NULL NULL NULL

NULL NULL NULL NULL

Time taken: 3.224 seconds, Fetched: 3 row(s)

I ran a similar test with a data set from work which is much larger, and also received a response to the select statement of all NULL values.  

At least I am doing something consistently wrong. ;)

Thank you all so much for the research and information!  

I wanted to share this: http://www.smartdatacollective.com/mtariq/120791/hadoop-toolbox-when-use-what.  It helped me understand maybe why different tools are useful and what they each bring to the table.

Thanks,
