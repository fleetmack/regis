Each VM has to be prepared with the following steps before the exercises can be run:

1. "Fix" the cloudera hadoop configuration per instructions in
   Cloudera_manager_changes.txt file

2. Create the "/user/data" directory in *HDFS* via the mk_user_data.sh script

3. Retrieve the exercise data and scripts "tar" file from somewhere
   (location and retrieval method tbd) and unpack in the /home/cloudera directory.

   i.e.
   a. Place Exercises.tar.gz in /home/cloudera
   b. cd /home/cloudera
   c. tar -xvf Exercises.tar.gz

4. Then the student performs the exercises per the exercise instructions using
   the data and scripts in /home/cloudera/Exercises.
